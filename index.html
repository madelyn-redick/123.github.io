    <h1>Madelyn Redick</h1>
    <p class="bio">I am a second year Data Science major, Neuroscience minor at Northeastern University.
        I am very interested in machine learning, computer vision, and data analytics.
        Outside of academics, I like to crochet, sew, woodowork, and embroider.
        I also believe that Danny DeVito is a <strong>fantastic</strong> actor, and that mountain goats are incredibly
        interesting creatures.</p>

    <p>Some things I would like to add to this website in the future:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My personal programming projects</li>
        <li>Pictures of my pets</li>
    </ul>
